# C# Basics for Beginners - Notes

## CLR - Common Language Runtime
When you compile C# is compiles to IL Code (Intermediate Language). CLR then takes the IL code into machine code using Just In Time compilation. That means you can write the program on Mac, then take the IL and run it on Windows

## Namespace
A collection of Classes that are related to each other
- Database
- Storage
- etc

## Assembly
A collection of Namespaces, such as a DLL or EXE

# Primitive Types
These are the common primitive types:
- byte
- short (2 bytes)
- int (4 bytes)
- long (8 bytes)
- float (4 bytes)
- double (8 bytes)
- decimal (16 bytes)
- char (2 bytes)
- bool

## var
Using `var` to declare variables lets C# detect the data type itself
```
char character = 'A';
var character = 'A';
```

NOTE that C# defaults to:
- int for intergers
- float for real numbers

## Overflow protection
By default there is no overflow protection. A byte variable with value 255 will overflow to 0 if it is incremented. To prevent this use the `checked` keyword to throw an exception if an overflow is detected:

```
checked
{
    byte number = 255;
    number++;
}
```

# Useful Classes
## Console
Used to interact with the console
- Console.WriteLine("x"); # Prints "x" to the Console
## Convert
 A collection of conversion methods for changing variable types
 - Convert.ToInt32(s);

# Visual Studio Shortcuts
- CMD-click on a type, method or class brings up the Assembly Browser so you can look through the available methods
- type cw <tab><tab> will fill in Console.WriteLine()
